                <p>Statistics and Background: According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2010, there were 2715 fatal traffic accidents in California which led to 3651 fatalities in drivers, 1589 fatalities in passengers, and 599 fatalities in pedestrians. Car accidents have also caused severe injuries and damages to people and their vehicles. Being an industrial place, Bay Area (which includes 9 following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma) experiences major as well as minor traffic accidents every day. Statistically, there are 8.04 and 3.85 fatal crashes per 100,000 people in Napa Country and San Francisco County, respectively. However, what happens after accidents has more impacts on whom involving in the crashes. Generally, people do not really understand how to fill out traffic reports and medical claims. Also, they are not aware of their rights/benefits to get treatment and have insurance pay for that amount. At those moments, people tend to be nervous and worried, and as a result, they do not know whom or what services to turn to for help

                <p>Guideline for Accident Assistance Services: At SEWA International, we hope to assist people who have involved in car accidents by providing them support and resources from creditable health clinics, law firms, and mechanics shops. We also want to build a bank of volunteers who can help victims with translating important documents, providing transportations, recommending the appropriate professionals or agencies, and so on. Following are guidelines of how Family Services Program along with volunteers can foster victims from car accidents so that we can all together serve our community better.
